2. Please prepare 1-2 questions on each paper, including your own paper, to be asked during the discussion period. To help you prepare questions, instructions on how to access the manuscripts are provided below. 
3. If you do not see a manuscript, that means one was not provided to AAEA.

Confirm the presentation order of the session and notify participants of any changes. Remind presenters to bring a thumb drive with their presentation.
Inform them the room will be equipped with an LCD projector, screen, and microphone and laptop computer. Encourage all presenters to meet with you in the session room 15 minutes prior to the session start time to resolve any last-minute issues. Presenters will also want to test their thumb drive to make sure all presentations are correctly loading.
