abstract: The transition to sustainable agriculture has underscored the critical role of Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) programs in addressing environmental challenges while supporting agricultural productivity. This paper examines the Northern Everglades Payment for Environmental Services Program (NE-PES) as a case study to derive insights for designing cost-effective and collaborative PES programs. The NE-PES program implemented a hybrid payment scheme that integrates action-based and results-based contracts, enhancing economic efficiency and accountability. Advanced monitoring technologies, such as hydrological modeling and remote sensing, support accurate verification of service delivery, fostering trust among diverse stakeholders. Despite its achievements, challenges such as scalability, integration of diverse ecosystem services, and stakeholder heterogeneity highlight the need for innovative approaches in program design and implementation. The findings from this paper highlight cost efficiency of PES contract design. The paper also offered strategies to address scalability and integration for policymakers and practitioners as PES programs expand under climate-smart agricultural policies.
